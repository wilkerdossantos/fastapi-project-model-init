# FastAPI Starter Template

This repository serves as a template for initiating a new project using FastAPI. I created it with the goal of making it easier for those who are starting and need a starting point. Suggestions and critiques are welcome.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or later installed
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) installed. You can install it using:

  ```bash
  pip install fastapi
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-starter.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fastapi-starter
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the FastAPI application:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The `--reload` flag enables automatic reloading of the server on code changes, which is convenient during development.

2. Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to view the FastAPI documentation and explore the API.
