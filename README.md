# FastAPI Starter Template

This repository serves as a template for starting a new project using FastAPI. I created it with the aim of making life easier for those who are starting out and need to start somewhere, suggestions and criticisms are welcome.
FastAPI is a modern and fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or later installed
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) installed. You can install it using:

  ```bash
  pip install fastapi
Installation
Clone the repository:

  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/wilkerdossantos/fastapi-starter.git
  ```
Change into the project directory:

  ```bash
cd fastapi-starter
  ```
Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
Usage
Run the FastAPI application:

  ```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
The --reload flag enables automatic reloading of the server on code changes, which is convenient during development.

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view the FastAPI documentation and explore the API.
